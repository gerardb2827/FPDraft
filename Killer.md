## What makes a Serial Killer?
The first thing detectives look for when making a profile on a killer is their MO, or _modus operandi_.
By definition its, "a particular way of doing something, especially one that is characteristic or well-established."
For a killer this might mean the tool they use to kill, who the victims are, and the time and place the murders happen.
